JT PyQt4 Custom Widgets
=======================

This is a small and (I hope) growing collection of PyQt4 custom widgets for use in your projects. 
The good point is that they are also QtDesigner plugins, so you can use them in QtDesigner as any other widget, just drag and drop.

One of the advantages of this implementation is that eases focus-chainage of widgets. Some of them has the method passFocusTo which
makes possible to define which widget is going to recive the applicaton focus using its method setPassFocusTo().

So far, the widgets are:

-    coordinateeditor: Derived from QLineEdit, it makes possible to type a geographic coordinate (Latitude or longitude) in several formats.
-    customcombodb: Derived from QComboBox, it makes possible to resolve foreign keys to choose values for a field in a database table. and also has pass-focus-to capability
-    itemlistselector: Two QListWidgets with buttons which make possible move elements from one list to the other.
-    customlineedit: Derived from QLineEdit, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites as well as multi-validation (real,integer)
-    customcheckbox: Derived from QCheckBox, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites
-    customplaintextedit:Derived from QPlainTextEdit, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites
-    customdateedit:Derived from QDateEdit, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites
-    customspinbox: Derived from QSpinBox, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites
-    customsdoublepinbox: Derived from QDoubleSpinBox, provides such a widget with pass-focus-to capabilites

The code is not as well documented as it would be desirable to be, but efforts are being made to improve it.
